Weather API Analysis with Python

This project uses Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. Use the OpenWeatherMap API to pull the data weather data for non-duplicate random cities throughout the world. 

Built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

For each of the cities (500+): 

* Collected weather data for each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.
* Included a print log of each city as it's being processed with the city number and city name.
* Scatter plot visualizations and CSVs (data stored in a CSV) 



Three observable trends:
